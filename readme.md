INERPRETATION:
Mean: 
Arithmetic mean value can be calculated by adding together all the values in a set and dividing the result by the number of members in the set. In this case Company Has Mean of 7037.25. That means Average of the Intelligence and the Extroversion depends upon 7037.25 of sales per week.

Standard Error:
A measure of the statistical accuracy of an estimate, equal to the standard deviation of the theoretical distribution of a large population of such estimates. Standard error says how much error we can accept. 

In this case we are ready to accept Standard Error of 254.8423.
Median:
The median is the value of the point which has half of the data smaller than that and half of the data more than that. In this case co. has a median of 6262.5.

Mode:	
The mode is the value that appears most often in a set of data. In this case 3150 appears most often in the set of data.
Standard Deviation:
The standard deviation, or SD, measures the amount of variability or dispersion for a subject set of data from the mean. In this case Co. has 284.4981.
Sample Variance:
Variance is defined as the average of the squared differences from the mean. Here Sample Variance is 80939.18.
Kurtosis:
Kurtosis is a measure of whether the data are heavy-tailed or light-tailed relative to a normal distribution. That is, data sets with high kurtosis tend to have heavy tails, or outliers. Data sets with low kurtosis tend to have light tails, or lack of outliers.
Here Kurtosis value is -0.64113. It shows negative Kurtosis. That means data set tend to have light tails, or lack of outliers.
Skewness: 
Here skewness is 0.17274. That is positively skewed.
 Positively skewed implies mean is on the right, tale is on the right, more observations are on the left. As the degree of skewness is less it can be inferred that the tale is thin.
Range:
In arithmetic, the range of a set of data is the difference between the largest and smallest values. Here Range is 955.

Interpretation of Regression:

Regression Equation
2188.50+2.91X1+8.60X2
Interpretation of b0:
 If X1=0 and X2=0 predicted sales per week is 2188.50.

X1 Interpretation:
If b0 =2188.50 and X2= 0, Every time intelligence increased by 1 then sales per week increases by 2.91.
X2   Interpretation if b0 = 2188.50 and X1 = 0, every time Extroversion increases by 1 then Sales per week increases by 8.60.
Adj r2 = 0.75 which is considered to be moderate model. 
75 % of variability in sales per week can be explained with the help of intelligence and extroversion of salesmen. The balance 25% is due to the other factors.

Hypothesis Testing:
H0 Sales per week is not significantly dependent upon Extroversion and Intelligence of salesman. 
H1 Sales per week is significantly dependent upon Extroversion and Intelligence of salesman.

Here P= 0.00, which is less than 0.05. Therefore, H0 is rejected and H1 is accepted. 
That means,
H1 Sales per week is significantly dependent upon Extroversion and Intelligence of salesman.

Analysis of Graph

1.Histogram
X axis is dependent variable that is intelligent and extroversion.
Y axis is independent variable that is sales per week.

When intelligent and extroversion are 850 and 3050 the sales per week is 25.
When intelligent and extroversion are 3050 and 5250 the sales per week increased to 45 and remain constant when intelligent and extroversion are 5250 and 7450 again sales per week decreases to33 when intelligent and extroversion are7450and 9650.
After that again sales per week decreases to15 when intelligent and extroversion are 9650 and 11850.

Sales per week increases to 24 when intelligent and extroversion are 11850and14050.
Sales per week decreases to 2 when intelligent and extroversion are 14050 and 16250 and remain constant for the value 16250 and 18450.

Advantages of Histogram
•	Visually strong  
•	Can compare to normal curve 
•	Usually vertical axis is a frequency count of items falling into each category

2.Pareto chart
A Pareto analysis is an observation of causes of problems that occur in either an organization or daily life, which is then displayed in a histogram. A histogram is a chart that prioritizes the causes of problems from the greatest to the least severe. The Pareto analysis is based on the Pareto Principle, also known as the 80/20 rule, which states that 20 percent of effort yields 80 percent of results.

3.Scatter chart
A scatter chart is used to compare at least two sets of values or pairs of data. It is used to show relationship between sets of values.

4.Bar graph
A bar graph is a chart that uses either horizontal or vertical bars to show comparisons among categories. One axis of the chart shows the specific categories being compared, and the other axis represents a discrete value.
